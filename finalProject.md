## Final Project Ideas
# Real time job fair application

- audience
  - students

- UI pages:
  - Admin login (recruiter fname, lname, date, location)
  - About Liberty ("Home" page)
  - Positions/Programs Available
  - Student Portal (enter name, e-mail, phone#, major, GPA, University, graduation date, position(s) interested in)
  - Developers: practice exercise pass/fail ?  code completion, multiple choice "quiz", other?
  - Logout (next student to register)

- Backend:
  - store students' info
  - store pass/fail/score ?

(Spring routes, database (postgres), security (recruiter's username/password), some way to implement a "test" for student developers to solve - similar to how NewLine presented the prework exercises)
