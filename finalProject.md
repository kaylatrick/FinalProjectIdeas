## Final Project Ideas
# Real time job fair application

- audience: students

- UI pages:
-- Admin login (recruiter)
-- About Liberty
-- Positions/Programs Available
-- Student Portal (enter name, e-mail, phone#, major, GPA, University, graduation date)
-- developers: practice exercise pass/fail ?

- Backend:
-- store students' info
-- store pass/fail ?

(Spring routes, database (postgres), security (recruiter's username/password), some way to implement a "test" for student developers to solve - similar to how NewLine presented the prework exercises)
